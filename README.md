# Conway

Featuring Mirko Sciachero, [Evelyn Loo](https://github.com/evelynloo), Jan Schnegotzki and myself.

For the first Zuhlke Singapore coding night since the circuit breaker period began, we built an implementation of [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
with a visualisation for iOS, written using Swift 5.
